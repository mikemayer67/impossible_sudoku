A second attempt at solving the "impossible sudoku" in the "Crack the Cryptic" video 
on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1G7GkIrWE.

A first attempt using a modified dancing link (DLX) algorithm met dismal failure.
This attempt will try to use some of the concepts behind DLX in a more brute force method.
